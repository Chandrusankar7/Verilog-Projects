This project concentrates on Design and synthesis an 8-bit ALU in Basys 3 FPGA and perform the following logic and arithmetic operations
1. Arithmetic Addition
ALU_Out = A + B;
2. Logical Shift Left
ALU_Out = A logical shifted left by 1;
3. Logical AND
ALU_Out = A AND B;
4. Logical XOR
ALU_Out = A XOR B;
5. Equal comparison
ALU_Out = 1 A = B else 0;
